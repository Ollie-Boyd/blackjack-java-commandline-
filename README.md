# Brief
### MVP

- Deal two cards to a dealer and a player
- Compare the hands
- Determine the winner from who has the highest value hand

### Extension

- Allow the player to "twist" or "stick" (Player go bust if hand value exceeds 21 and they automatically lose the round).
- Dealer will twist if hand < 16
- Compare hands once both dealer and player have stuck.
- Allow for more players to play.

# My approach
### Initial thoughts
- This is my first chance to combine OOP in Java with some fun game logic. 

### Planning
- I have played a half-hour on an online blackjack trainer to refamiliarise myself with the rules. There was an odd student culture in Dundee where it was very normal to go the casino once the nightclubs had let-out. It brought back memories of trying to get as much play time out of a tenner on the low-stakes tables as possible. I have never gambled since but gambling addiction has fascinated me ever since reading Natasha Dow Schull's superb sociological thesis on machine-gambling design, addiction, and its effects in her book "Addiction by Design; Machine Gambling in Las Vegas". Published in 2014 but just as relevant in the gamified internet of 2020. 
- I have diagrammed how I imagine the classes' methods and properties will look like.
### Known unknowns
- I haven't used Java for command-line user interaction before so I will need to quickly figure that out. 
- I have brifly seen mention of the intricacies of handling money in Java on StackOverflow so I will need to live into that a little.
- I don't know how to format terminal output like I can in Ruby but I don't think I'll waste my time with that. 

### A notepad for what I've learned along the way. This is for personal future reference so it's a bit messy.
