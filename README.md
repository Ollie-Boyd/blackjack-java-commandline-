### Brief
## MVP

- Deal two cards to a dealer and a player
- Compare the hands
- Determine the winner from who has the highest value hand

## Extension

- Allow the player to "twist" or "stick" (Player go bust if hand value exceeds 21 and they automatically lose the round).
- Dealer will twist if hand < 16
- Compare hands once both dealer and player have stuck.
- Allow for more players to play.
